# Sparse Coding

![](./trained_models/RF.png)

This is an implementation of Olshausen and Field's sparse coding paper in PyTorch. Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm 
(ISTA) is used to fit neuronal responses for the input. Gradients for receptive fields are calculated through PyTorh's autograd
feature. 

## Run
To run the program:
```python
cd src/scripts
python train.py 
```
To see a list of available hyperparameters to change:
```python
python train.py -h
```
A checkpoint of the model is saved every 10 epochs to `trained_models`. To see the tensorboard logs:
```python
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

## Will be added soon
* Fast-ISTA
